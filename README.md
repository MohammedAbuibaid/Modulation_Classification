# Modulation_Classification
Using CNN to classify RF modulation data.


Dataset is from: https://www.deepsig.ai/datasets

I attempted to recreate the results of Tim O'Shea in this paper:
Over the Air Deep Learning
Based Radio Signal Classification
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04578.pdf


While I accomplished it slightly different I believe that it did verify 
and recreate the results in the paper.

Enjoy.
